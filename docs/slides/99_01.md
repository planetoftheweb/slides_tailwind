There's a lot more great information on the Tailwinds CSS site. One of my favorite things is the search. If you click on the search area, you can quickly find any properties or other information about TailwindsCSS.

You're going to use this all the time when you need information about a specific class or need to know how to customize things.

Another great place to find sample components is Codepen itself. Just do a search for tailwind and you'll be able to see how people build components using the framework.
