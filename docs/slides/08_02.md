# JIT Variants

<div class="slide-link"><a href="https://go.raybo.org/5YbO"><i class="fab fa-slideshare"></i> go.raybo.org/5YbO</a></div>

> >

Just in time adds lots of variants that you really couldn't put in a combined CSS file, or it would create a huge final CSS stylesheet.

---

# Before/After Variants

`before:` `after:`

> >

You now have access to before and after variants within JIT mode only. So example you can go to the [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and add an icon to your page.

---

# First Letter/Line

`first-letter:` `first-line:`

> >

You can also use first letter and first line variants, which let you modify some text on your page. For example `first-line:text-4xl` will make only the first line bigger.

---

# Selection Variant

`selection:`

> >

You can also change the color of the selected text.

`<body class="selection:bg-purple-800 selection:text-white">`

---

# Empty Variant

`empty:`

> >

The empty variant is super helpful if you want to style an element when it doesn't have something in it.

`<body class="selection:bg-purple-800 selection:text-white">`

---

# Pseudo Classes

`only` `first-of-type` `last-of-type` `only-of-type` `target` `default` `indeterminate` `placeholder-shown` `autofill` `required` `valid` `invalid` `in-range` `out-of-range`

```html
<div class="mx-auto w-16">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-600 mt-4">Cast</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Red</li>
    <li contenteditable="true"></li>
    <li>Bubbles</li>
  </ol>
</div>
```

  <div class="text-center">
    <h1 class="before:content-['❤️‍🔥'] before:block mt-24 text-5xl px-6 font-extrabold text-red-500 tracking-tight">About Binaryville</h1>
    <img class="rotate-[10deg] blur-[2px] w-32 mx-auto" src="http://pixelprowess.com/i/powship.svg" alt="POW Ship" />
    <p class="first-line:text-4xl mt-4 max-w-2xl px-6 text-xl text-gray-500 mx-auto">
      On the edge of the world stands the progressive town of Binaryville, where technology is a way of life. The robots who live, work, and play in
      Binaryville learn from an early age that magic is made simply by combining 0's and 1's. For the Binaryville robots, every waking thought and
      every sleeping dream is consumed with unique permutations…and endless possibilities.
