# JIT Variants

<div class="slide-link"><a href="https://go.raybo.org/2cDk"><i class="fab fa-slideshare"></i> go.raybo.org/2cDk</a></div>

> >

Just in time adds lots of variants that you really couldn't put in a combined CSS file, or it would create a huge final CSS stylesheet.

---

# Before/After Variants

`before:` `after:`

> >

You now have access to before and after variants within JIT mode only. So example you can go to the [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and add an icon to your page.

---

# First Letter/Line

`first-letter:` `first-line:`

> >

You can also use first letter and first line variants, which let you modify some text on your page. For example `first-line:text-4xl` will make only the first line bigger.

---

# Selection Variant

`selection:`

> >

You can also change the color of the selected text.

`<body class="selection:bg-purple-800 selection:text-white">`

---
# Empty Variant

`empty:`

> >

The empty variant is super helpful if you want to style an element when it doesn't have something in it.

`<body class="selection:bg-purple-800 selection:text-white">`

---
