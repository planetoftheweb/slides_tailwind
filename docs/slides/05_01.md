# Flexbox

<div class="slide-link"><a href="https://go.raybo.org/2cEn"><i class="fab fa-slideshare"></i> go.raybo.org/2cEn</a></div>

One of the ways you can choose to organize your layouts is using the flexbox properties.

# Flex Direction

- `flex(-TYP)(-DIR)`
  - **TYP**<br>
  `row` `col`
  - **DIR**<br>
  `reverse`

You can control the direction that flexbox operates in a few different ways. In addition to adding a flex class, you can add a direction type with a direction option.

# Flex Wrap

`flex-wrap` `flex-wrap-reverse` `flex-nowrap`

<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-wrap" target="_blank"><code class="code-exciting">Docs</code></a> <a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/NWRpgRq?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

You can tell an item to wrap to a next line or not with these classes. The default is for items not to wrap, but you can also have them wrap in reverse.

# Flex

`flex-1` `flex-auto` `flex-initial` `flex-none`

Flex elements can grown and shrink, so there's a set of classes that let you control that.

`flex-1` lets an item grow and shrink as needed, but ignores the original size.

`flex-auto` lets an item grow and shrink as needed, taking into account the original size.

`flex-initial` lets an item shrink, but not grow.

`flex-none` prevents an item from growing or shrinking.

# Flex Grow


`flex-grow-0` `flex-grow`

<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-grow" target="_blank"><code class="code-exciting">Docs</code></a> <a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/PoGpKoz?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

There's a couple of tags that you can also use to control wether an item grows to fit space as well, but it's a bit different than the previous items.

`flex-grow` lets an item grow to fit the available space.

`flex-grow-0` prevents and item from growning.

---

# Flex Shrink


`flex-shrink-0` `flex-shrink`

<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-shrink" target="_blank"><code class="code-exciting">Docs</code></a> <a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/rNMyzxq?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

Like grow, the shrink classes control how an element shrinks. 

`flex-shrink-0` prevents an item from shrinking

`flex-shrink` allows an item to shrink if needed.

# Order

- `order(-ORD)`
  - **ORD**<br>
  `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` `10` `11` `12`<BR>
  `first` `last` `none`

<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/order" target="_blank"><code class="code-exciting">Docs</code></a> <a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/ExgWvXJ?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

Order lets you control the order that the items in a container appear in. You can assign more than one item the same order and they sort of work like layers, keeping items with the same order together.

There's a couple of named classes. `first` attempts to put an item first and has precendence over the other numbers. `last` does the same thing for the end. None is like a special order of zero.
