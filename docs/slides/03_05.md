Tailwind has a simple way of adding drop shadows to box elements. There are two special sizes. none, which serves as a reset and inner which places a slight shadow effect inside the box element. It's important to note that you can't make any of the other sizes an inner size.

Then there are the traditional sizes `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` and `2xl`. If you just use the keyword shadow without the size, you get a shadow that's 1 pixels wide and 3 pixels to the right. You can see them at work in the example.
