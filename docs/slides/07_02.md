Tailwind doesn't have very many classes for tables, relying on the rest of the tags to do most of the work.

# Table Layout

`table-auto` `table-fixed`

These first group of classes let you control wether the browser decides to auto-size your table with `table-auto` or if you want all cells to be the exact same size with `table-fixed`.

You can see by my example that you style tables with the same set of classes that you use for everything else.

`table-auto` is also the default, so you don't have to add it, but it's good if you need to programmatically reset the border.

`border-collapse` `border-separate`
